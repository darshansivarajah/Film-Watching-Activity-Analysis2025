2023-11-21,The Lighthouse,2019,https://boxd.it/5c97Yj,4,Yes,"Simultaneously a mind-bending psychological horror and a dark comedy, The Lighthouse uses cinematography, music and sound design to put you are in a constant state of discomfort. Robert and Max Eggers power their characters with unique, period-appropriate speech and mannerisms. 

The committed performances from Pattinson and Dafoe are the highlights of the film, and they provide the majority of the entertainment value, compensating for the muddy storyline. The film features just two characters (for the most part), and even though Winslow is the vehicle in which we experience their world, it is only just that we focus on both the “wickies”; for they are both equally interesting and important. The actors adopt archaic accents, grow facial hair and play unique characters in such a way that they are unrecognizable; I don’t see Pattinson and Dafoe when looking at Winslow and Wake, respectively. Immersion is crucial to take audiences on an emotional ride, and the pair could not have done much better. The range of emotions expressed in the film is surprisingly vast and the two actors’ commitment to their roles is clear for all to see. 

Jarin Blaschke's cinematography was stunning and appropriate for the mood of the film. Mark Korven's music was equally as effective, using 'sounds of the sea' to enhance the immersive factor. 

Despite its quality in acting and production, it suffers from a story that seems to lack substance – or perhaps it is packed with too much of it; it’s hard to tell in this instance because it is quite ambiguous. Eggers does not present any clear resolution, instead choosing to pass the content off to the audience to come up with their own interpretation. There are interesting theories to be drawn, and it was enough for me to find it satisfying, but I also understand that it may leave much to be desired for certain viewers.",wtf cinema❓,2023-09-21
2023-12-18,American Beauty,1999,https://boxd.it/5lvAyJ,5,,"A bonafide classic, critical of the suburban lifestyle of the typical American family in the 90s, <i>American Beauty</i> is a film that delivers impressively cohesive narratives on several ideas.

Though modern audiences may not connect to the complacency of pre-9/11 America as strongly, and though some people may still have their pitchforks and torches out for Kevin Spacey, this film remains relevant on many levels. 

It is a picture about liberation and appreciation for life, while also touching on the damaging behavior that we subconsciously adopt. Love is complex, and many shades are explored here: romantic and paternal love; the fine line between love and lust; and heterosexual and homosexual relationships, to name a few. Another major theme that this film touches on is conformity. Naturally, we all want to fit in, and this film tells us that our desire for that is okay. However, it also challenges us to look past the rat race and our goals that are built on insecurity – or even the goals that have been thrown upon us by society. A focus on purpose, meaning, and self-respect opens the door to a happier life that may currently evade us due to our tampered vision.

2023-12-20,Back to the Future,1985,https://boxd.it/5m2Hul,5,,"This was my first time watching this film and it was on the big screen, in a packed audience. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE! This is one of the most complete movies I've ever watched from an entertainment perspective. I enjoyed the comedy, the acting was fun, and the music was amazing. The composed theme and the songs were great ('Earth Angel' was my favorite).

Looking back at the influences that this movie had on culture... I get it. Coming out of the theater, I wanted to dress up like Marty McFly and start doing kick-flips. 

This is definitely in my top 10 films of all time.

2023-12-20,Halloween,1978,https://boxd.it/5m2LKd,4,,"I watched this in a busy theater the week before Halloween day. It was a really fun experience! I enjoyed the simple premise of the movie. The camera work was ingenious, and Carpenter's Halloween theme is effective and iconic. There were many laugh-out-loud moments; the sign of a successful, campy, horror movie - a.k.a my favorite kind of horror film. Don't get me wrong, Robert Eggers' work is leaps and bounds superior in terms of cinematic quality, but I'm a bit of a scardey-cat.",watched in theater,2023-10-22
2023-12-20,The Batman,2022,https://boxd.it/5m2WwV,5,,"One of the most memorable movie experiences I've had. I was PUMPED going into the theater, having watched the trailer consistently over a multi-month-long period. 

I appreciated every single moment of that film. I loved the slow spacing and didn't want the film to end (despite its nearly three-hour runtime). The soundtrack and cinematography are in my top three for those categories. The dark and gritty take was great and I think this is the best bat suit out of all the film adaptations of the character. 

The memory that comes to mind when thinking about watching the movie is the reveal of the Batmobile preceding the chase sequence. I got goosebumps! I shook my head in awe and looked at my brother who was sitting next to me. He looked back at me, also overwhelmed by the scene. 

I will defend Battinson 'til the day I die. I can not wait for the sequel.",watched in theater,2022-03-04
2023-12-27,Poor Things,2023,https://boxd.it/5pic5X,5,,"I have a love-hate relationship with Yorgos Lanthimos' films. His unique, bizarre style scratches an itch for me that no other filmmaker has. I've always wanted to love his work - the components are there - but something always seems to stand in the way; something that I can never quite articulate. 

Poor Things is exactly what I've wanted from all of Lanthimos' prior films. He went all out with this one, but it strangely feels like a ""mainstream"" version of his style. I'm not complaining. I want more like this (though I don't expect his future works to be like this). 

It may have been a little too long, but I enjoyed the whole thing. Possibly one of the best Frankenstein-type films?",watched in theater,2023-12-26
2024-03-03,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,2003,https://boxd.it/5XLW7J,5,Yes,"The ultimate film. Unrivaled in scale, capping off the greatest film trilogy, Return of the King takes on a monumental task and delivers on all fronts. There’s so many little plot points to conclude and at no point does it feel forced. The emotional journey that the film takes you on is bulletproof; you feel every triumph, scare and loss regardless of how familiar you are with the story. 

I was grateful to see the extended edition in a packed theater today and it was unbelievable. This is my umpteenth viewing of this film, yet it was as profound as it has ever been for me. 

<i>Return of the King<i/> is a pillar of my childhood that shall stand strong for the rest of time.

P.S. the Lord of the Rings movies have the best commentaries (out of the films l’ve seen) on what it means to be a man, and I think more people should pay attention to that.

P.S.S. The audience applauded Denethor’s suicide. I quite enjoyed that.",watched in theater,2024-03-02
2024-03-04,Dune: Part Two,2024,https://boxd.it/5Yhsj5,5,,"The beauty of Dune: Part Two is one to behold. Craftsmanship of the highest order is on display for all to appreciate. The sheer scale is not so common in modern films. 

The cast is stacked, and their performances are strong. Austin Butler, Rebecca Ferguson, and Javier Bardem were the show-stealers for me.

The Fremen’s continual surprise at Paul’s actions got tiring. I felt as though many were getting convinced as Paul showed heavy signs throughout the film, and the large reactions to come again and again up to the very end detracted from my personal experience. 

If I could rate this a 4.9, I would. I will settle on 5.0 on principle, for more movies of this caliber must be made. Long live the fighters!",watched in theater,2024-03-03
2024-03-06,The Holdovers,2023,https://boxd.it/5ZhD5d,4.5,,"The Holdovers caught me off guard, proving that it was one of the most well-rounded films of the year. A healthy dose of comedy and drama that kept me entertained for its entire run-time. It really moved me, and presented life lessons worth pondering on.

My favorite element of the film was the rich writing, which produced profound, poetic and comical dialogue. Each character is also fleshed out well; you really get to know them. The acting from Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa and Da’Vine Joy Randolph was flawless. The cinematography captured the 70s nostalgic look well and I really enjoyed the soundtrack.",,2024-03-05
2024-03-08,The Zone of Interest,2023,https://boxd.it/605mNR,4.5,,"The Zone of Interest captures the life of the commandant of Auschwitz and his family, in all its mundanity. The plot is pretty much non-existent and we don’t get to know the characters well, but that’s the point. This film is about the banality of evil, showing how dissociated their family is from the horrors occurring next door (one of Auschwitz’s perimeter walls doubles as their garden wall). 

The Zone of Interest has the best use of sound out of any film that I’ve experienced. With purposefully substanceless dialogue, the sound tells the story. The movie was easy on the eye too, with every shot giving a fly-on-the-wall kind of feel. 

The director, Jonathan Glazer, presents the film as objectively as one could. This encourages us, the audience, to make our own judgments.",,2024-03-07
2024-03-10,Naked,1993,https://boxd.it/6177e1,4,,"A raw film that prompts us to project our opinions and ideas on it, regarding what is right and wrong, as well as what life is about. It is also grounding, reminding us that events like these do occur in reality. 

David Thewlis is outstanding, and the supporting cast delivers strong performances too.",,2024-03-09
2024-03-11,Call Me by Your Name,2017,https://boxd.it/61vJzJ,4.5,,"A portrayal of love that you don't see often in film. Not just because it's about a gay relationship, but because it was honest, unfiltered and oh-so genuine. Despite the amount of sex in this film, I would also say that it was quite innocent, in a way. 

<i>Call Me By Your Name</i> also explores the confusing feelings that introduce themselves throughout our young adult years - the excitement and the self-disgust. Watching this felt as therapeutic as it was enjoyable. 

Timothy Chalamet is really good in this film. Another highlight would be the setting of Northern Italy, which I couldn't help but admire.",,2024-03-10
2024-03-23,Anyone But You,2023,https://boxd.it/66XqQH,2.5,,"Acting was questionable. Situations made me want to roll my eyes. Humor was pretty weak. Character logic was strange.

I understand that this was an adaptation of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" but the Shakespeare quotes felt very out of place.

That being said, it was dumb fun.",misc. screening,2024-03-22
2024-03-24,The Crow,1994,https://boxd.it/67zYGn,5,,"A gothic masterpiece that is a love story at its core. The plot is minimalistic but that allows the other elements of film form to get the attention they deserve. I appreciated the rock music, the gothic architecture, and the graphic novel-esque cinematography.

The flashbacks to the fateful incident are disturbing, but add a lot to the overall mood. There is a lot of violence in this film, making it as bloody as it is beautiful. 

Usually, the protagonist has flaws to overcome but Eric seems perfect. This man has been through hell (no pun intended) but manages to be rational in his pursuit of vengeance. He made me want to dress up in black and put make-up on.

This film reminded me of <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/darsiv6/film/the-batman/""><i>The Batman</i></a>, and I wasn’t surprised to read that Matt Reeves took inspiration from <i>The Crow</i>.

2024-03-31,American Psycho,2000,https://boxd.it/6aV2JJ,4.5,Yes,"I like to dissect movies. Did you know I’m utterly insane?

The content is dark and sickening, but it’s ultimately a well-executed satire at its core. How could you not laugh at the absurdity of yuppie culture?

This is my third time watching this film and it gets better with every rewatch. It took me two watches to have a satisfying interpretation, though the ambiguity is such that I can’t say it’s concrete. That being said, I really appreciate films that leave the audience to interpret their experience.

I love Christian Bale. His performance, considering the context of the themes of the book/movie, is a strong one. There are parts that I felt were awkward or overplayed, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

Mary Harron also deserves a lot of praise. The film required a woman’s touch, to maintain the ideas and themes from the book while not making it gratuitously graphic.

Would've loved to give it a 5-star rating, but certain overacted moments and an imperfect conclusion detracted from my overall experience.",watched in theater,2024-03-30

2024-04-12,Monkey Man,2024,https://boxd.it/6g6Vo9,4,,"Monkey Man is a pretty impressive directorial debut from Dev Patel, who also stars as our protagonist. This was much more than the typical revenge movie. I appreciated the political/social commentaries woven in as much as I loved the action sequences. Regarding the commentaries, I felt like the film bit off more than it could chew; it highlighted them, but there wasn't a strong message. 

The use of symbolism added a lot to the movie, and the flashback scenes were on point. They were the core of the story.

The cinematography was beautiful, though at times the dynamic nature of it sometimes made it difficult to see what was going on. The close-ups were often used effectively but also occasionally contributed to the confusion. The music choices were jarring but didn’t detract much from my experience.

I rarely get to see someone of my skin complexion and culture kick ass like this in a film of this standard, so having that representation was pretty cool. 

I don’t usually watch all-out action movies but I’m glad I watched this one. I should probably watch more.",watched in theater,2024-04-11
2024-04-22,Dead Poets Society,1989,https://boxd.it/6k8dCh,5,,"I got goosebumps as the credits rolled. 

With many of the boys facing their unique problems, the movie provides ample opportunities for us to relate to the characters, in one way or another. 

Though the cinematography and soundtrack were strong, they didn't catch my attention. This is a compliment in this instance, for it allowed me to get swept away by the story. The writing was *chef's kiss*. It's rare that the writing strikes me as particularly exquisite, but the dialogue in this film was at times hilarious, awkward (in an appropriate way), and deeply inspiring. This film reads like literature, with its themes so clearly explored; symbolism served to us on plates for interpretation; and character arcs so well-defined. 

Great performances from everyone in the cast too. They were perfect vehicles to convey the vast range of emotions expressed throughout the film.

I was moved by the film. God knows I needed a dose of inspiration and ""Dead Poets Society"" maxed out my meter. This has established itself as an all-timer. Just wow.

2024-04-28,Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,1971,https://boxd.it/6muZ4J,5,,"Looking past the tasty aesthetics and sweet score, the story is an inspiring one. It highlights the importance of having a good heart and living by a righteous moral code while caring to dream of creating something of significant, sentimental value. This is what I live for, and it is always touching for me to see those themes depicted in art. I enjoyed the musical numbers too.

Gene Wilder’s performance was a highlight, to say the least. A man with composure and care, though a little unhinged. That’s what a high sugar intake does to you, I guess. I loved the character. There’s something inspiring about him.

I watched this in an empty auditorium, and I feel like it wouldn’t have been as impactful if other people were there. I will definitely watch this film again down the road. It moved me. And remember…

2024-05-01,Star Wars: The Force Awakens,2015,https://boxd.it/6nMgBX,3.5,Yes,"The Force Awakens was a solid start to the sequel trilogy, with intriguing plot lines that would've been interesting to explore in future installments, had Disney dived in with a proper plan. I liked the new main cast, and I felt that the actors delivered strong performances. 

The movie relied too heavily on characters and story beats from the original trilogy for my liking. At times, it felt too contrived (like the Millennium Falcon being on Jakku, and Rey and Finn running into Han and Chewie as soon as they steal it). The new ideas that were introduced were pretty cool though; Kylo Ren and Finn had interesting backgrounds and potential trajectories. 

The cinematography was cool and the music was as epic as expected. John Williams'  Rey theme and Kylo Ren's theme were the pick of the bunch.

This is my third time watching this film. Despite my immense and incomparable love for the prequel trilogy, I can easily admit that this movie surpasses those films in quality on most fronts. I deeply hope that the sequel trilogy will get its flowers the same way the prequels have.",,2024-04-30
2024-05-03,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,2017,https://boxd.it/6oDbEN,3.5,Yes,"Continuing my rewatch of the sequel trilogy, this film isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. There were many points that I didn't like, but there were many newly introduced elements that I thought were pretty neat. Rey and Kylo's connection was a skill I hope to see explored more. The same can be said for the ability to cast a force projection. 

I loved the Battle of Crait sequence, from the Resistance's defense to Rey and Ben's silent stare-down. Once again, Kylo Ren proves to be my favorite part of the sequels. Yoda's inclusion was nostalgia bait but I felt as though it was handled surprisingly well. I thought the Holdo maneuver was epic. Questions can be raised as to why this isn't a more common tactic, but I don't know enough about hyperspace travel to comment on the matter any further. 

For the parts I didn't like: I despised the MCU-esque humor. Poe's 'your mom' joke and the cheesy one-liners almost had me gagging. The scenes with DJ weren't good either (at no fault of Benicio del Toro). Last but definitely not least, the off-screen death of Admiral Ackbar was a crime. 

As for Luke... there were good and bad bits. I felt that this was the most interesting canon depiction of the character. People may find it jarring because of the stark contrast from Return of the Jedi, but if we take into consideration the events that occurred in between trilogies, it makes sense. However, with Luke being a shining symbol in the original trilogy of hope and justice, I can understand why people would get upset. 

Music and aesthetic value were expectedly top-notch. 

Far from a perfect movie, The Last Jedi is a decent follow-up to The Force Awakens. The prequel trilogy was far from good (though I adore them) and I feel like the sequel trilogy up to this point is a better set of Star Wars films. The Last Jedi is what Star Wars is about, and I'm tired of people not being able to get past the numerous faults. Ultimately, it's worth focusing on the strong points than festering in the lows.",,2024-05-02
2024-05-04,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,2019,https://boxd.it/6p4tTv,3,Yes,"Thus my rewatch of the sequel trilogy comes to an end. My negative image of the sequel trilogy has largely evaporated, leaving me not understanding why I avoided thinking of it for so long. I think being exposed to constant hatred directed towards the movies has a part to play in it. 

Now, don't get me wrong, this movie in particular is HEAVILY FLAWED. It suffers from a severely lazy plot and horribly weak exposition. The infamous ""somehow, Palpatine returned"" is inexcusable from a film coming from a franchise of this scale. Hux being a spy and lightspeed skipping only scratches the surface of the ridiculousness. 

All that being said, I love Star Wars and I choose to focus on the beauty of it. The stunning visuals and transitions are pure eye-candy and I don't think any Star Wars film has ever looked this good. Putting technological advancements aside, the shot composition and poetry in the editing is a real treat. John Williams (who I'm glad to see made a cameo in the film) returns with yet another brilliant score. His out-spoken admiration for Rey's character is captured in the many ways that he utilizes her leitmotif.  

Though I commented on the dreadful 'MCU humor' of The Last Jedi, I felt like it was tolerable in this one. Overall, I surprisingly enjoyed it. Detaching myself from the tone of the preceding two trilogies helps, and I don't think that is a bad thing to have to do. 

The emotional beats of the movie were on point. The grand finale was an epic rollercoaster and the cinematic poetry was satisfying (with the exception of Rey and Kylo Ren's final moment together). 

Overall, I'm glad that I chose to rewatch the sequels. Despite many lazy story-telling moments and awful inventions that jeopardize the laws of the universe, there was a lot to love. Hell, the prequels were often pretty shocking film-wise too (though I have to reiterate that I adore them). With time, I hope people come around to the sequels. Calls to decanonize the movies may be better for the Star Wars universe's health, but it would be a real shame. It's good to see modern Star Wars content attempting to retroactively flesh out the story, as it really helps. I hope this era gets more investing and I am very much looking forward to the announced Rey project.",,2024-05-03

The plot wasn't great but it was loads of fun. The production design was really impressive, though that's expected after the quality of the original trilogy. The CGI is a bit suspect and the racial stereotypes were much worse than I remembered.

The Duel of Fates sequence was definitely the highlight for me. Hearing maestro John Williams’ music over the intercut scenes of the lightsaber duel and the mission in the Theed Royal Palace gave me goosebumps. I also really enjoyed the Gungan scenes. Jar Jar was very jarring, but I appreciate him.

The film was funnier than I remembered (not just because of my increased familiarity with Star Wars meme culture), and I have a newfound appreciation for the dynamic duo: R2-D2 and C-3PO. Now, I’ve always loved them, but they were never characters that I paid special attention to - until now. Out of our three main heroes, Carrie Fisher shines brightest as Leia Organa. Luke and Han were charming as ever. The cantina aliens were something that I observed more closely this time, as I'd previously overlooked them. 

Overall, I had a very different experience watching the film again now. I came away with new takes and different opinions.

This is Fury Road before Fury Road, and it's impressive to see the difference in style brought about by improved technology, increased resources, and - I would assume - confidence and maturity. 

The stunt work was incredible in this movie, though it's not something that I know enough about to delve into. I am more aware of the cinematographic quality, and I was inspired by the use of dissolves and overlays throughout. I'm also a big fan of when movies use prologues and narration because it frames/bookends the film nicely. I appreciate structural elements like that.

The purple/yellow/gold colors in silhouette sequences were especially aesthetically pleasing too. 

Overall, I have to applaud it for being a committed film that made strong stylistic choices that aren't often seen in other movies. The foreign appearance created its dystopian complexion. The story was miles better than the original, and I adore filmmakers with original ideas and a 'full send' attitude.",,2024-05-17
2024-05-22,Casablanca,1942,https://boxd.it/6wm8Rn,5,,"I've had this on my watchlist for a long time, and knowing that it was a revered classic, I felt like I needed to brace myself for disappointment (don't ask me why, but that's usually my first response). It blew my expectations out of the water!

The story is laid out in what I felt was an easy-to-understand manner, but with the interesting characters involved, I didn't know which direction we were heading; every turn was a mystery to me. The characters are what make the movie. Their complicated histories and unknown motives, gave the movie a layer of complexion that I appreciated. 

Max Steiner's score serves its purpose perfectly. The editing wasn't fancy and proves that following the fundamental principles is enough to do a fantastic job. The cinematography is admirable too, with shadows in the black-and-white aesthetic used to great effect.",watched for class,2024-05-21

The cinematography was a treat too. The shots of the city, mundane objects, and characters doing nothing of interest gave the movie time to breathe and helped with the pacing; it magnified the emotional effect on me. The soundtrack and sound design were phenomenal. I am definitely going to check out the soundtrack. The acting was also solid.

2024-05-26,The Empire Strikes Back,1980,https://boxd.it/6y0jut,5,Yes,"I watched this today at the State Theatre, State College, PA. It always feels special to watch a film with a large audience and this was no different.

As with most rewatches, you catch something new every time. I recall kid-me finding the Dagobah scenes uninteresting but that could not be further from the truth this time around. I LOVED Yoda, in all his kookiness and wisdom. I used to find it awkward, but I thought 'ketamine Yoda' was hilarious! When Yoda becomes serious and starts training Luke, I found his advice very impactful and touching. 

In my recent Star Wars (1977) review, I mentioned Leia being the shining star of the main trio. In this one, I feel like every character has an incredibly strong arc and I loved them equally. I also mentioned that I have a new-found respect for the droid duo, and that continues in this sequel. I'd also extend that sentiment to ol' Chewie. 

The music by John Williams once again touched my soul. The aesthetics of this movie were also particularly outstanding. The different locations, from Hoth to Dagobah to Bespin were diverse and exceptionally well-designed. I especially liked the retro-futuristic feel of Bespin.

'The Empire Strikes Back' is up there with my favorite films of all time and it has been that way for a long while. It's a rare case of the sequel being better than the original.

2024-05-27,Mad Max: Fury Road,2015,https://boxd.it/6yte0V,5,Yes,"Having recently watched the first three Mad Max films for the first time, I appreciate Fury Road even more now. 

""The mastermind"" George Miller returned to his franchise and made something more unique and adventurous than any of his previous installments. The acting was strong from the main cast, and some moments of awkward acting and dialogue seemed appropriate given that it's a Mad Max movie. Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult are the shining stars. 

The editing was insane. The editing techniques used to facilitate the fast pace were genius. The ""kamakrazee"" number of cuts was surprisingly seamless thanks to the purposeful framing throughout. The double vision effect from the opening scene was a nice call back to Max crashing in The Road Warrior. HUGE kudos to Margaret Sixel. 

Junkie XL's music was equally outstanding. It played a big part in setting the mood of the film and tied the action scenes together well.

The highly saturated colors set this apart from other apocalypse films. I also liked the purple-gold skies in some scenes, which is a staple in films from the franchise.

Overall, it was a helluva movie. With so many bold stylistic choices, the best action scenes in the genre, and interesting world-building, this is close to perfect. I love committed filmmaking, so I am inclined to round my rating up.",,2024-05-26
2024-05-28,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024,https://boxd.it/6yLEUh,4,,"Definitely a film that you have to watch in the theater. It is a long film split into a few different chapters, which coupled with its execution makes it an epic saga. 

The creativity behind the action sequences had me grinning. They were ridiculously good and can only be compared to Fury Road. The same can be said for the cinematography and JunkieXL's music. It seemed more gory than Fury Road - which surprised me - but it felt in place given the darker atmosphere of this film. 

Anya Talyor-Joy, Alyla Browne, and Chris Hemsworth were incredible! Furiosa is likely my favorite heroine and Dementus may be one of my favorite movie villains.

It was funny and managed to be frightening without relying heavily on cheap scares. I'm quite the scaredy cat, so it's no surprise that this movie freaked me out. However, it was so amusing that I made a real effort not to look away.

Out of all the films in the franchise, Return of the Jedi (joint with Rogue One) best encapsulates why I love Star Wars.; the extensive world-building, the exploration of the theme of hope, the soundtrack, and the aesthetic. 

I always thought of the Jabba's Palace portion to be one of my favorites, and I appreciate it even more as I grow older. In this rewatch, the final duel and Vader's redemption wowed me. Prior to this, I didn't consider it one of the stand-out sequences in the saga but I was especially impressed this time around.

Return of the Jedi is a fine film that strongly concludes one of the best trilogies of all time. It leaves me with a sense of warmth and comfort that few things can. Boy, do I love Star Wars!",,2024-05-30
2024-06-05,Godzilla Minus One,2023,https://boxd.it/6CdFZv,4.5,," I - like most - appreciated the focus on the humans here. The characters were well-developed, and their journeys had me interested. All the emotional beats hit, and I teared up at the end of the movie.

Godzilla, itself, was fearsome. I think I preferred how the recent American versions looked, but I felt that this version fit the style of the movie well. With the humans being the focus, I'm glad the filmmakers chose to keep the kaiju a one-dimensional beast whose only purpose is to cause mass destruction and chaos. 

Despite all the positives, I do have complaints. There was quite a bit of extended exposition through the dialogue, which resulted in certain scenes feeling uneventful and too long. I thought some of the acting was over-the-top/goofy/unnatural too (though I don't know if it's because of my unfamiliarity with Japanese communication). In my opinion, both factors got in the way of the immersive quality.

However, I appreciate this film so much more now as an adult, with years of fond memories, increased knowledge about Lego lore, as well as the maturity to reflect on the themes. 

I thought the humor was handled well and the voice acting was noticeably great. The Lego-specific references are plenty and are so satisfying to see! Every 30 seconds, it was [insert Rick Dalton pointing at the TV here].

Interweaving the 'in-universe' plot with the adult-child interaction in the last act moved me. I once lived in my own world with my bricks and minifigures, creating wild escapades. Now I'm at a point where I'm so strict and particular with my lifestyle; everything I do and create must be grounded with logic, deeper meaning, and of an unrealistically high standard.

It actually bored me; in fact, it irritated me. I think my rating is especially low because I had recently read the book. 

First and foremost, I want to bring up the acting. It was of a high standard, don't get me wrong, but certain choices just didn't feel right. Peter Sellers' overacting was intolerable. I get that Kubrick wanted to lean into the darkly comedic side to the story, but I didn't appreciate the humor in the slightest. And James Mason's accent... it felt right for Humbert Humbert, the sophisticated, impressively articulated man. That being said, I couldn't stand it. That's purely a me problem though, because it did feel appropriate for the character. 

The length of the film was necessary to fit in the important scenes from the book, and I can recognize that the censorship regulations of the time limited the extent of mature content that could be presented. That being said, I felt like it wasn't nearly as good as it should've been.",,2024-06-24

I loved the dialogue; it has the charm of most classics from the era. The characters were colorful, and the acting was great (especially from the main trio that we follow in the latter half). I always felt like the stakes were clear and increasing in magnitude. I was totally absorbed - I guess you could say that Spielberg had me hook, line and sinker. Not many films manage to rope me in as effectively as Jaws.

One perk of watching a film like this with an audience: you don't feel like a total sucker when you get jump scared. Why? Because it was comforting to know that I wasn't the only one who literally jumped out of their seats.

2024-07-12,The Fabelmans,2022,https://boxd.it/6R8cgL,4.5,,"I can not understate how wonderfully inspiring and moving this experience was. 

All the themes that were explored pulled at my heartstrings; partly because they were conveyed through breathtaking performances and partly because the messages themselves hit so close to home. 

The balancing act of committing to ambition and making time for meaningful connections/experiences is one that I struggle with more than most. The dilemma of selfishness and selflessness, wrestling with one's vocation, and the isolation caused by introspection and maturity, take up a significant portion of my daily thoughts. Plus, the obstacles that the Fabelmans face are similar to the fears that contaminate my fantasies.

To see a work of art translate those relatable, complex, abstract ideas and fears into a tangible display left me overwhelmed. 

I'd like to leave this review with two quotes:

Rather than manipulating elements sparingly to make some scenes scarier than others (and heightening the impact of those scenes), they make EVERY scene freaky. Watching this movie felt like self-harm, but it was simultaneously satisfying; not unlike eating intolerably spicy food. 

I really liked the static shots and zooms, and appreciated the purposeful use of diegetic sound and non-diegetic music. Despite loving Cage’s performance, I think we saw a bit too much of Longlegs. A couple of short scenes felt superfluous and detracted from the character's fear factor.

There is so much to adore in front of our eyes, yet we focus on what is out of our reach. Hirayama's sweet approach to life is night and day when compared to my modus vivendi.

Hirayama is evidently a man with scars, but we don't get much of a look at the hardships that he faced (and may still quietly face internally). What prevents me from moving past what I immaturely perceive to be acts of injustice against me, is the idea that the world will never know about my inner turmoil. Perfect Days' minimal exploration of Hirayama's difficulties reminds us that no one is watching; you have to heal out of respect for yourself. A life of peace, unphased by other people and unexpected circumstances, is possible and it is up to us to seek it. 

I liked the montages, and the song selection was class. The aesthetic, coupled with how likable Hirayama is, made it a comforting watch. I will admit, that I was distracted while watching this by unwelcome thoughts - how improper and ironic - and I look forward to revisiting this with my undivided attention.

Despite stoking the fire that is my quarter-life crisis, it's so refreshing to see a depiction of life that is simple and rewarding. It's important to recognize that being ordinary is okay. The question is: am I willing to prioritize inner peace at the expense of my ambition?",japan 🇯🇵,2024-08-28

The opening sequence itself gave me goosebumps. 

Jennifer Gray was delightful and Swayze was dripping with sauce. I thought the characters were well-written and their arcs were satisfying. I also appreciated the theme of status. It never felt forced and served as a powerful, grounding story element, making the dance sequences feel like relieving punctuations in the best way possible.

Despite the neorealist approach, we can develop a great understanding of what is going on in the mind of the protagonist, and it is emotional despite the lack of drama. 

I enjoyed the objective filmmaking, with all the close-up camerawork and the sparing use of single reaction shots (instead opting to use mirrors). It felt claustrophobic, the way one would feel when operating in a push cart, but it's also how it feels to be stuck in your head.

I like films about lonely people, so naturally I appreciated this one. However, I tend to prefer movies that have defined character arcs with character progression/development; which this lacks. Of course, this fits the realism that Bahrani is going for and parallels the Sisyphean myth that he was inspired by. That's a matter of personal preference than anything else.

I'm drawn to films about lonely, neglected folk, so this hits the spot, but it's not worth writing home about. I genuinely liked this, but it's disappointing. 

This is not nearly as good as I remembered it. Having recently watched The King of Comedy, I especially feel that this one pales in comparison. There are so many parallels that one could draw between the two, that it doesn't feel like a homage; it feels cheap. The writing fell flat in some parts and the plot isn't captivating.

It's such an awesomely perverted way of depicting a murder, and I love it. Hitchcock wants you to suffer through his movies, but Argento rewards you with a theatrical slaughtering. 

The dialogue is charming and the cinematography is fun. The color saturation gives the film a sweetness. I enjoyed the mystery aspect of the film, and I was happy to play along for a while, but my patience began to wear off towards the end. I adored this regardless.

Everything unravels at incredible speed and you sit there hoping that the puzzle pieces fall in place. The beautiful part about Lynch's mind-benders is that there is no objectively correct answer.

The sound design editing and cinematography are masterful. The blaring of the foghorn, the taunting of the seagulls, and the wailing of the sirens are haunting. The sound designers play with the concept of sound fidelity to capture the ambiguity of the plot. This ambiguity is also communicated through the use of montage within scenes, as well as the disjunctive nature in which scenes are stitched side-by-side. We lose track of time the same way our protagonist does. The high contrast black-and-whites works very well too, not only to give the impression of a period piece but to set the tone.

Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson are awesome to watch here, both scary and hilarious. They are both on my Mount Rushmore of best actors currently working. Robert Eggers needs to get more love. His direction and writing are incredible. The New England-Shakespearean prose was entertaining - difficult to understand but I appreciated it. Eggers is the king of period pieces.

This makes me think of Balazs' ""The Face of Man"" and ""The Close-up."" Even though we never see an entire face in focus, there was immense emotional power in showing a fragment of the human face, which can communicate so much expression as it is. The most notable example was a quivering lip. There is so much emotion expressed without showing the whole face. It's not about relating to the individuals in the film, it's about empathizing with the large number of women who suffer domestic abuse. 

Coupled with the sparing, calculated coverage of the faces, was the interesting use of sound. We don't see voices attached to the movement of mouths, which brought up the idea of Chion's ""The Accousmetre."" We don't know exactly who each voice is attached to, so the women pictured here speak on behalf of all women who endure domestic violence.

Chazelle is clearly a film historian with a soft spot for classical Hollywood studio films (also apparent when watching <a href=""https://boxd.it/5rQ4Cb"">Babylon</a>). He leans into the conventions associated with the musical, using vivid colors popular in Demy's films, the artificial sets used in Fordist Hollywood studio productions, and of course the brief appearance of a black top hat. The film has a Utopian (in the Richard Dyer sense) beginning and subverts expectations by ending on an imperfect cadence. 

The music and sound design was the most notable achievement - duh, it's a musical. Mia and Sebastian's theme served as a strong leitmotif that always felt fresh and welcomed due to the variation in voice and texture. The range of volume was used effectively, and the blend of diegetic/non-diegetic music was efficacious in transitioning from scene to scene in a flowy fashion.

Every friend and acquaintance may have an idea of who we are, but those designs are merely pieces of a jigsaw puzzle without a reference picture. Our true selves exist separately from the image that survives (and dies) in history. 

The beauty of this film - to me, at least - lies in the cinematography and the screenplay. To begin with the cinematography, Greg Tolland's use of lighting and camera angles was particularly notable. I've never seen a film use low-angle shots the way he did during Kane's conversation with a drunken Leland.

The screenplay not only presented ground-breaking narrative techniques, but I thought that Charles Foster Kane was a character that was expertly crafted. Despite learning a lot about his motivations, it is still difficult for the viewer to connect them to his actions. Even the little details speak volumes; for instance, I interpreted his statue-collecting habits as him being able to acquire valuable 'people' who couldn't abandon him. 

My main criticism of the film is the editing. The disjunct cuts between musical phrases; the abrupt fades/cuts after a line of dialogue at the end of scenes; the mix of fades, dissolves, and zooms... it felt like it lacked organization. The time jumps, though usually solidly executed, sometimes felt patchy. Despite the narrative importance of the ""News on the March"" sequence, I thought there was more exposition than necessary.

The aesthetic of the shots had a warm vintage feel that I loved. However, the use of the mobile frame and the editing was mediocre, because they lacked inventiveness.

Roy Cohn might be the more interesting part of the story though, as we explore his contribution to Trump's character. 

The integration of found footage of New York City into this grainy period piece was very well done. I adore the camera work here too, with the mobile frame effectively capturing the energy of Trump's insatiable hunger for success and his meteoric rise to power. 

With a film about this kind of subject matter, I couldn't help but fear that the narrative could be interpreted as a glorification of Trump, but that isn't the case. Some aspects may come off that way, but it's clear to see him shed his humanity, becoming apathetic, selfish, and corrupt.

When watching some of the scenes, my mind defaulted to thinking that writers were taking an egregious amount of creative license, but that isn't the case as often as I thought.

Unlike many films that tackle discrimination, it doesn't feel like an agenda is being pushed. I acknowledge that this film's purpose is to give a voice to the underrepresented, showing what immigrant youths inhabiting banlieues have to deal with, but it doesn't sacrifice empathy for the cops. The immigrants aren't depicted as model citizens as they often cause trouble, but they are also unfairly subject to harassment from the police. The police, shown doing despicable things, also include good men trying to uphold peace. There isn't a set of 'good' and 'bad' characters, but rather a collection of people who are only reacting to the hate that they witness and experience. <i>""Hate breeds hate.""</i>

I also appreciate that despite the cultural diversity within the main trio (a Jew, a Black African, and an Arab), there is no reference to racial stereotypes - not even in their banter. Films that directly address stereotypes often inadvertently reinforce them by bringing attention to them. The absence of these stereotypes in this movie thwarts them by default. 

There are many moments of off-kilter camera work and editing which give this film a vibrant flair that matches the rebellious street culture. The smash cuts, dolly zoom, and flying-cam shot were interesting choices.

Actually, I don't think that there is much intent from Kubrick to communicate concrete meaning. On the contrary, this film poses contradictions that underline the complexity of human sexuality. 

Throughout this film, we explore the fine line between temptation and restraint, as well as the dichotomy of sexual repression and debauchery. We see these themes play out between husband and wife, father and daughter, and across economic classes. The most significant dynamic is the broader one between men and women. For thousands of years, the narrative on female sexuality has been controlled by men, disparaging the idea that women too can desire. This film exposes that male insecurity and showcases that women have the equal potential to act out of lust. 

At one point in this film, I noticed a lens flair, which broke the immersion and brought my attention to the voyeuristic role that I was playing as a film viewer. What is voyeurism if not a substitute for gratification by more involved means? When Bill and Victor conversate at a pool table, Victor asks, ""you like playing?"" to which Bill responds, ""you go ahead; I'll watch.""

I was pleasantly surprised when I genuinely enjoyed it! It felt very authentic to the Middle Earth created in the live-action movies.

Hearing Howard Shore's score and Éowyn's voice-over was like a warm hug. Héra was an awesome protagonist and I am glad that the story revolves around her (unlike the source material, which I'm not familiar with).

Let's talk about love. It's heart-warming to watch Paterson and Laura embrace the mundanity of daily life and support each other in their creative endeavors. Paterson doesn't always seem thrilled with Laura, but the harmony in their home is more important than anything else. Love isn't about ideals and perfection, it's about compromise, empathy, and teamwork. 

Additionally, the balance of adventure through creation and comfort through routine is what keeps life interesting. 

This film promotes the perspective that being content and the idea of impermanence are the keys to freedom. This interpretation contradicts my modus vivendi, and will serve as food for thought for a while to come. 

Additional thoughts:
- This is one of the best films about a city' that I've seen. The protagonist identifies with the city like a person identifies with their twin.

2025-01-08,Nosferatu the Vampyre,1979,https://boxd.it/8mlaLb,3.5,,"Herzog creates a faithful remake of Murnau’s <i><a href=""https://boxd.it/8lq5XH"">Nosferatu</a></i>. I actually appreciated how closely Herzog follows the rhythm and plot structure of the original, deviating to include his trademark, documentary-style, hand-held shots of the locations. He also takes advantage of dialogue to further develop (and improve) the characters, and licensing to change the characters' names to match those from the original Dracula novel - two luxuries Murnau didn’t have. 

The talented and gorgeous Isabelle Adjani is the heart of the film. We sympathize with her character’s (Lucy’s) longing for the return of her beloved Jonathan. Then, when Dracula comes to Wismar with The Black Death, she takes responsibility to neutralize him. It's satisfying to root for her. A strong performance fit for a well-written character, that builds greatly from the original. On the other hand, I do not have much appreciation for Klaus Kinski’s Count Dracula. I expected a maniac like Kinski to bring more to the table. 

My favorite totally new addition is the scene where Lucy walks through the Wismar square amongst townspeople who have accepted their fates, celebrating life amongst the death carried by rats. 

Herzog delivers a valuable tribute to a classic and includes enough newness to justify its creation — a very solid movie.

His remake pays homage to <i><a href=""https://boxd.it/8lq5XH"">Nosferatu (1922)</a></i> by including landmark scenes and through German Expressionist cinematography. The use of blues and oranges looks like a nod to the ‘tinting’ technique used in the original. 

The significant amount of newness makes it Eggers’ own. The storyline is a lot more complex, and the supporting characters are much more important to the narrative. The free-flying camera is a major stylistic change, and it mirrors Orlok’s omnipotence. 

This adaptation demands more from the actors. Lily-Rose Depp deserves all the awards and everyone’s praise. Nicholas Hoult and Bill Skarsgård delivered tour-de-force performances too. 

Orlok blew me away. His deep voice (which was apparently not pitch-modulated!) and Transylvanian accent demonstrate the powers of sound, a tool that Murnau did not have. His period-accurate appearance and menacing silhouette are different from previous looks, and it’s for the better.

Eggers is respectful in the way he orchestrates his symphony of suspense, meticulous in his research, mature in his exploration of the occult, and fluent enough with directing that he can establish his own film style. I’m biased, but I think he’s the best in the business!

2025-01-16,Wavelength,1967,https://boxd.it/8utyah,,,"The concept of a film being one long take is a simple one, but Michael Snow creates an intriguing art piece here. I appreciated this more than I thought I would. However, I have to mention that I watched this while multi-tasking, so it wasn't as endurance-testing as it otherwise would've been. 

The manipulation of time fascinated me. There are minimal cuts, which leaves long uneventful periods in the film - parts that would be cut out of a typical narrative film. The sky outside goes from day to night, so it's ambiguous whether the time lapsed in the story is equal to the runtime. I surprisingly liked that.

Every 11 to 12 minutes, the screen goes white, which I assume is because they have to switch out the film in the camera. This was visually frustrating but I can understand the necessity of doing so for the sake of the concept. However, towards the end, there is a BLATANT cut to a different angle! Snow even cuts to skip a few seconds of the zoom! Maybe I'm missing the point, but that bugged me. I thought it defeated the purpose.

Last but not least, it was comforting how unromantic and non-precious it was. The visual 'fuzz' wasn't aesthetically pleasing, but this film is still highly acclaimed. A movie's value is not strictly attached to its tidiness!",canada 🇨🇦,2025-01-15

The sets (or the illusion of sets) are impressive, but my favorite part was the music. Doug Jones plays Orlok well, and the prosthetics for his character were solid. 

My biggest gripe is the editing, which is unflattering to the actors. The camera is uninvolved and largely static, cutting to a semi-tight shot before cutting back to a wide shot. It fails to create any tension. The framing is often too wide, which gives a stage-play feel. There are a few strong moments though, and I wished more of the film was as creative.

The first half was perfect. Jaw-dropping visuals were accompanied by a soaring soundtrack. Events unfolded at a controlled pace, with character development and thematic exploration occurring satisfyingly and with great purpose. An intimate story was presented in marvelous grandiosity. Emotionally, I was all in. I got goosebumps. Not once - even for a second - did I lose interest.

The same can not be said about the second half though. The quality of the screenplay was exposed. It felt as though the movie had lost a sense of focus and direction, stripping away the tenderness. Despite its 3.5-hour runtime, it managed not to depict the characters’ transitions gradually. There was a disconnect, a missing piece, that I find difficult to articulate. The last 20-30 minutes were unsatisfying. A lack of closure coupled with an inconsistent cinematic style - I'm not talking about the epilogue - made for a bizarre conclusion.

I applaud Brady Corbet for his resilience in taking on such a vast project. His immoderacy and lack of conclusivity is a crime that I am hesitant to forgive, though he largely delivered and I respect that this was his vision. Adrien Brody, Guy Pearce, and Felicity Jones are fantastic. I can’t ask for much more than for artists to commit to their work.

The most fascinating part for me was Herzog's exploration of the contradictions of the protagonist: what is presented as a selfless crusade is very much intertwined with his demons. 

I was not so hot on the odd theatrical performances by a few major interviewees. Herzog's presence in the film as the sometimes-visible interviewer and narrator also felt a little odd here.

I appreciated the cinematography too. I think it sits alongside <i><a href=""https://boxd.it/5m32M1"">Multiverse of Madness</a></i> as being one of the more stylized Marvel movies (thought a bit more subtle).

Herzog says that he is a poet before a filmmaker, hence the nature of the dialogue, but it does not work for me. His signature themes of innate, natural evil in man are present but don't seem well-explored. This was apparently based on an unfinished play. I am unfamiliar with it so that may take away from my appreciation (though that shouldn't take away from the experience).

I am disappointed with the coverage of the transportation sequence; such a monumental task deserved to be filmed better. Regardless, it was a sight to behold.

It's a modest documentary but that is also its downfall. There doesn't seem to be a motivating force. Herzog doesn't need to be present for his documentaries to be good, but this could've benefitted from having more of his personality. The opening sequence and the final scene were most impactful, which happen to be the scenes in which Herzog is most involved (physically).

<i>“A work of art does not answer questions, it provokes them; and its essential meaning is in the tension between the contradictory answers.”</i>

Herzog is clearly interested in presenting the contradictions. The subject is Gene Scott, a televangelist, preaching in God's name while exploiting his viewers. This manipulative persona is anger-inducing, but Herzog also teases emotional answers out of him that make me feel empathetic. Scott mentions that his viewers either love him or hate him, but I find it difficult to fall into a single camp. 

I enjoyed some of the hymns that were performed on Scott's show. The FCC Monkey Band was unbelievable. The decision to leave that footage until near the end is another example of Herzog recognizing the power of piercing endings.

Three cheers for guerilla filmmaking! It's the only way they were able to capture the haunting imagery.

The editing, for one, is insane. The repetition of shots not only draws connections between childhood experiences and the adult psyche but adds to the chaotic energy. Crazy cuts across time and space, disjointed and seamless, force us to consider the abstractness of the film rather than to understand it. The montage, the superimposition, the demonstration of the power of the Kuleshov effect... brilliant!

The symbolism was fascinating and the animation reinforced its surrealism. Everything was much more impressive when I learned that it was semi-autobiographical. 

Despite my appreciation for many of its artistic decisions, I did not enjoy it. I'd never listened to Pink Floyd before this, so I didn't have that emotional connection (though I think the music is cool). My biggest complaint is that for the first half of the film, any sense of momentum is snuffed out as soon as things get exciting. Earlier, I praised the abstraction, but I wished that I could understand it better. The lack of temporal continuity, though interesting, frustrated me.

Everything feels so real, likely because it is; Cobra Verde crushes a live crab, real Ghanaian tribes are cast, Taparica falls on his head and is in great pain (though it clearly wasn't intentional), etc. It gave the film a sense of realism that raised the stakes. 

I don't like praising Kinski but he was fantastic in this. This was his best performance by far, playing a feral criminal turned viceroy. When he shuffles around with a spear, pointing it at people, I genuinely felt frightened for the extras. 

I had trouble following the story, it wasn't engaging, and it was messy (partly due to Kinski's on-set shenanigans). I'm still not a big fan of Herzog's narrative films, but his methods, subtext, and style intrigue me.

The Futurist convergence of the body and the machine in the form of a hyper-sexual fixation is an incredible idea! As technology improves, it becomes more integrated into our lives; one can argue that the smartphone is an extension of the human self. There was more potential to explore these ideas, but rather than involving us in the act like a voyeur, it (intentionally) keeps us a little distant. 

Cronenberg delivers a largely faithful adaptation, making a sensible decision to tone down the intensity of the novel. He captures the cold tone of the book too.

There are so many layers to explore, about literal masks and metaphorical masks (like make-up and alcohol); juggling versions of ourselves to maintain our reputations; and the proposal that morality is a consequence of sculpting our public image. An independent subplot possibly hints at Japan’s identity crisis post-World War II, as a scarred nation. This pushes the question of identity even further.

I appreciate how clearly the ideas were expressed. Some may criticize Teshigahara for not showing enough restraint, but I think the ideas are so abstract that it provides enough food for thought.

He uses narrative framing in many of his films but manages to do it in a unique way here.

Switches between color and black-&-white, selective hand-held camerawork, split screens, illusory freeze frames, animation, aspect ratio changes and non-intuitive subtitle formatting are all utilized seemingly arbitrarily but it somehow works.

It's clear to see how the ""fresco"" vignette in Fellini's film inspired <i>La Chimera</i>, with Rohrwacher even including a direct homage with the real-time fading of paintings. Another similarity between the two Italian films is that they are heartfully character-driven rather than plot-focused. <i>Roma</i> is an impressionistic portrait of the titular city (treated like a character) while <i>La Chimera</i> holds a subjective lens over the protagonist's life post-prison. 

Moving past the comparisons, Rohrwacher's film explores the longing for the past and one's search for the elusive. We all ""long for [a] fuller life"" and our ""heart[s] nourished by a richer source."" It also challenges machismo and male ideals by contrasting modern patriarchies to Etruscan social organization. 

Creative editing is employed, like vertically flipping the image, and there is also interesting mixing of music genres.

His analog approach to editing (despite the rise of digital methods) brings a sense of tangibility and grit - I think the magnitude of my appreciation would not have been as great if it had been a digitally-made product. 

I'm particularly drawn to his focus on film form and the materiality of film. He splices the found-footage often and shows the film stock's sprockets and optical soundtrack.

Both of them are major highlights. Luthor's (short and merciless) interrogation of Superman was also an awesome scene. Another feature of Gunn's films is his camera movement, which was hyperactive and had a fun sense of personality. The score was epic, and I liked the Man of Steel's costume. 

However, it was difficult to overlook the weak narrative. There is way too much going on in the story. There was interdimensional technology, war, kaijus, and so forth. It felt scattered. There is so much exposition in this film, which is conveyed incredibly poorly, with minimal subtlety.

There's also the perverse interest in amputations. These two films are Freudian in their psychology and speak to the violent, disruptive nature of trauma.","⭐ greenaway gamut, kanopy",2025-08-06

In his prior film, he explored its relationship with evolution and the natural life cycle. In this film, he ties decay to the artist's creative ambitions (that tend to become self-destructive). 

A tale of self-manifested tragedy set against baroque Roman backdrops is a grand affair. It doesn't hit the heights of the two other narrative films by Greenaway that I've seen, but it's still quality.

It's interesting how he fits in his mathematical/scientific fixations. They doesn't serve the story in a significant way, yet their inclusions feel natural - they're a part of Greenaway's worlds. 

<i>Drowning by Numbers</i>, like the other films I've seen from this director, has a quirky sense of humor that is right up my alley. What kind of writer names a teen boy ""Smut""? It doesn't matter - he had my heart. It's been a while since I've been this fond of a character.

2025-08-20,Le Dormeur,1974,https://boxd.it/aN7ZmH,,,"Just finished reading <i>Sculpting in Time</i> by <a href=""https://boxd.it/GTU3a"">Andrei Tarkovsky</a>. I want to review this short film (by Pascal Aubier) through the lens of Tarkovsky's philosophy before diving into the book specifically.


<b>REVIEW</b>

Tarkovsky describes an idea that is represented in <i>Le Dormeur</i> called time pressure. The perceived compression or stretching of time is influenced by editing, which ""disturbs the passage of time, interrupts it and simultaneously gives it something new."" The job of editing isn't to create a rhythm out of the footage; it is to bring forth the rhythm that is already present. Aubier chooses not to cut at all in this film, so the rhythm is dictated by the camera's movement within the space and the environment itself. We experience everything in real time, which is as faithful to life as it gets. 

<i>Le Dormeur</i> also stays loyal in its cinematic representation of life by avoiding the use of literal concepts like symbols and metaphors. “The function of the image, as Gogol said, is to express life itself, not ideas or arguments about life. It does not signify life or symbolize it, but embodies it, expressing its uniqueness.” The simple presentation of this nine-minute piece does not promote ideology or aim to manipulate the audience; it leaves them with the responsibility to feel and ponder.


<b>THOUGHTS ON <i>SCULPTING IN TIME</i></b>

This book was a life-changing and affirming read. It has significantly influenced my philosophy on cinema, introducing me to the importance of expressing life and being truthful as an artist. I felt comforted to see my daily struggles reflected in Tarkovsky's writings about human duty and responsibility. To fight against the oppressive forces of life that have crushed the ideas of spirituality and reward superficiality. 

My disagreements with Tarkovsky lie in his downplaying of aesthetic importance to art. Films can truthfully represent life and respect the audience with literary tools like symbolism. It may not be as authentic as he believes necessary, but it shouldn't be considered unprofessional. 

I would like to leave this reflection with a few quotes from Tarkovsky that deeply resonated with me. 


<b>QUOTES FROM <i>SCULPTING IN TIME</i></b>

1. “We live in a world governed by ideas which other people have evolved, and we either have to conform to the standards of these ideas or else alienate ourselves from them and contradict them - a position which becomes more and more hopeless.”

2. “The issue of freedom raises the question of experience and upbringing. Modern man, in his struggle for freedom, demands personal liberation in the sense of license for the individual to do anything he wants. But that is an illusion of freedom, and man will only be heading for disenchantment if he pursues it. It takes a long, hard struggle on the part of the individual to liberate his spiritual energies. Upbringing has to be superseded by self-discipline: otherwise, he will only be capable of understanding his newly acquired liberty in terms of vulgar consumerism.”

3. “Of course, all art is artificial. It only symbolizes the truth. That’s obvious enough. But the sort of artificiality that comes from lack of skill, of professional flair, cannot be passed off as style; when exaggeration is not inherent in the imagery but is merely an exaggerated attempt and desire to please, it’s a sign of provincialism, of the wish to be noticed as an artist. What the audience deserves is respect, a sense of their own dignity.”

4. ""The past is far more real, or at any rate more stable, more resilient than the present. The present slips and vanishes like sand between the fingers, acquiring material weight only in its recollection.""","⭐ sculpting in time, watched at work, france 🇫🇷, profile",2025-08-19
